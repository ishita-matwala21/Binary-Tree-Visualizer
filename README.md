# Binary-Tree-Visualizer
The application allows users to input an array of numbers and visualize it as a binary tree or a max-heap. It also provides a visualization of a binary search tree for sorted input data. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with D3.js for rendering the visualizations.
