# Binary-Tree-Visualizer
The application allows users to input an array of numbers and visualize it as a binary tree or a max-heap. It also provides a visualization of a binary search tree for sorted input data. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with D3.js for rendering the visualizations. Users can interact with the visualizations by clicking on elements to highlight corresponding locations in the data structure. The project provides an educational tool for understanding binary tree structures and algorithms.
